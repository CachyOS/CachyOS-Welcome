<big>Handling hardware</big>

CachyOS not only supports the use of multiple kernels (selectable from the advanced options at the boot screen), but also provides access to the very latest bleeding-edge kernels as well. This can be done through the use of the Kernel module in CachyOS's graphical Settings Manager, or via the command line using the MHWD-kernel (CachyOS Hardware Detection) command.

These CachyOS tools will automatically update a newly installed kernel along with any modules currently in use with your existing kernel. For example, if you were to update from kernel 3.18 to 4.1, MHWD-kernel would automatically include the kernel 4.1 builds and all modules used with kernel 3.18. How about that!

You can configure your hardware through the Hardware Detection module in the Settings Manager or alternatively with the MHWD cli-application. With these tools, you can install for example graphical drivers, free and proprietary.

<big>Getting help</big>

Although CachyOS is designed to work as much "out of the box" as possible, we don't claim it's perfect. There can be times when things go wrong, you might have questions and a desire to learn more, or just want to personalize it to suit your tastes. This page provides details of some available resources to help you!

<b>Search the web</b>

Perhaps the first place to look for generic Linux help is by using your favorite search engine. Just include words like 'Linux', 'CachyOS' or 'Arch' in your search query.

As CachyOS is based on Arch Linux, guides and tips designed for Arch usually apply to CachyOS too.

<b>Look in the forums</b>

For specific help with CachyOS we have a dedicated online forum where you can search for topics, or create one yourself! This is probably the next best place to go for collaboration, discussion and assistance. Ask for help, post your thoughts, or outline some suggestions. Don't be shy!

The CachyOS forum is divided into sub-forums for different topics and environments, please post your query in the appropriate place!

<b>Sign up to a mailing list</b>

Another way to get help is to email questions to CachyOS mailing list (you can also search the history for past discussions). Simply sign up to the list you prefer and follow the instructions. There is a list dedicated to several topics, just take a look!

<big>CachyOS 24.03</big>

Greetings, CachyOS enthusiasts!

This is our third release in 2024 and brings quite big changes.
We are dropping our GNOME ISO due to a lack of maintenance and double testing for every release. Also, this should avoid confusion among users about the netinstallation,
and supported desktop environments, since we are providing most desktop environments directly in the netinstall.

This ISO is based on Plasma 6 and will also have Wayland enabled by default. This should not have a big impact on NVIDIA users since X11 can still be used after the installation.
Plasma 6 seems wayland wise in really good shape, and as soon wayland-protocols and NVIDIA provide the explicit sync protocol, this should also be the case for most NVIDIA users.

On top of that, we are now providing new CDNs as default, one hosted by a community user and one is hosted by us via Cloudflare R2. This should massively improve the netinstallation time across the world.

Calamares got rebased on 3.3.5 and is now built as a default with QT6 instead of QT5, to follow with Plasma 6.
Arch recently made some changes to mkinitcpio and enabled early microcode loading as a default. These changes are also now reflected in our installation for all bootloaders.

Refind has some more filesystems enabled - f2fs and zfs are now available if the refind bootloader is selected.
